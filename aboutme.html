          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Anita and since January 2017 I'm programming. Last year I graduaded Medical University of Wroclaw and I'm physiotherapist. It's really hard phycial work. When I was starting I didn't realise it would be so hard. In May 2016 I've decided to change something to make my future life better. My friends encouraged me to lern programming. And you know what? I really liked it! I've started at Codecademy, but then I had more and more questions. One day on Facebook I saw a commercial from CodersLab - School of programming. And then I thought - why not to try? After 2 months really hard intellectual work and hectolitres of caffee - here I am. My social life is broken but I've achieved my goal ;-) Now I can do a lot of things in CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and so much more! I know I still have a lot work to do, but I can't wait. Anyway I think it's quite good start ;-) Go ahead and look at my first project Sit on Chair in <span>projects</span> section.</p>
