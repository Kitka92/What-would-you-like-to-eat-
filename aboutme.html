          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hi! I am Anita and I have been coding since January 2017. I graduated from the University of Wroclaw where I studied physiotherapy. Shortly after I started practicing, I realised it was not a job for me. 
          I started to think about changing career. My friends suggested to me that I should try my strengths in coding and I found it interesting. I like programming very much.
          I started programming at Code Academy but it was not enough. One day I found an advertisement on Facebook from Code School encouraging people like me to enrol on a course to become a front-end web developer. And I thought, why not trying? 
          I understand that my skills might be limited but I am eager to learn more. I code as often as I can. Please check my portfolio and my first project ‘Sit on Chair’.</p>
